# snake-game
Coding a snake game using C++..
Members: Nicolas Hidalgo Rotunno, Geary Erua
The game has to be compiled using this: g++ snake.cpp snakemain.cpp -lncurses
There is a small bug with the code. The fruit disappears sometimes, this is not constant, but it weirdly happens. In case that the fruit disappears,
I would just suggest you to run the code again, and it should work normally.

Finally, the more fruits you eat the higher the score will be, but the harder it will become
because the speed of the snake will increase depending on the score of the game.
