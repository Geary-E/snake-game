# snake-game
Coding a snake game using C++..
Members: Nicolas Hidalgo Rotunno, Geary Erua
The game has to be compiles using this: g++ snake.cpp snakemain.cpp -lncurses
There is a small bug with the code. The fruit dissapears sometimes, this is not constant, but it is weird to happen. In case that the fruit dissapears,
I would just suggest you com run the code again, and it should work normally.

Finally, the more fruits you eat the higher the score will be, but the hardest it will become
because the speed of the snake will increase depending on the score of the game.
